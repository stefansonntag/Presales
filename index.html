Over the last two decades the role that is accountable for the technical part in a software sales cycle has evolved from a narrow profiled job to a veritable, multi-faceted profession.
I have spent most of my professional life in this field and built a career from being an individual contributor to being the leader of very large, multinational technical sales organizations.
Every company naturally had it's specific challenges but time and again there were themes that I found very similar in all assignments: the "base line" of every technical sales organiaztion.
Having seen many of these I felt it might be helpful to collect them as "topics to think about". Given the differences of markets and their players, however,  "one size fits all solutions" can hardly exist and so I decided to address each areas with questions you may want to ask yourself or your teams to find YOUR best solution.
