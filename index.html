Over the last two decades the role that is accountable for the technical part in a software sales cycle has evolved from a narrow profiled job to a veritable, multi-faceted profession.
I have spent most of my professional life in this field and built a career from being an individual contributor to leading very large, multinational technical sales organizations.
Naturally, every company had it's specific challenges but there were areas that needed work in all my assignments: the "base line" of every technical sales organization.
Having worked on many of these over the last couple of years I felt it might be helpful for others to collect them as "topics to think about".
Given the differences of markets and their players "one size fits all solutions" can not exist and so this collection is rather comprised of many bullet points,
questions, maybe an idea here and there but not of out of the box solutions applicable to every Presales team in the world. Please feel free to comment wherever you want or to contact me for a dialogue.
