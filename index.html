Over the last two decades the role that is accountable for the technical part in a software sales cycle has evolved from a narrow profiled job to a veritable, multi-faceted profession.
I have spent most of my professional life in this field and built a career from starting as an individual contributor to leading very large, multinational technical sales organizations.
Naturally, every company had it's specific challenges but there were also areas very similar in their nature that I found in all my assignments: the "base line" of every technical sales organization.
Having worked on many of these I felt it might be helpful for others to collect them as "topics to think about" as they grow into their role or grow their teams.
Obvioulsy, with all the differences between markets "one size fits all solutions" cannot exist. Consequentially, this collection is comprised of bullet points,
questions to ask, maybe an idea here and there but not of "out of the box" approaches applicable to every Presales team in the world.
