Over the last two decades the role which is accountable for the technical part in a software sales cycle has evolved from a narrow profiled job to a veritable, multi-faceted profession.
I have spent most of my career in this field and was very fortunate to build a career from being an individual contributor to being the leader of very large, multinational technical sales organizations.
Off course every assignment had it's own challenges but there are equally many topics that are alike from company to company, the "base line" for every technical sales organiaztion, if you will.
Having seen many of these challenges I felt it might be helpful to collect them in the form of "topics to think about". As each company and market is different there can hardly be good "one size fits all solutions"
but the topics themselves seem quite universal.
