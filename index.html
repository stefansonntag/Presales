Over the last two decades the role that is accountable for the technical part in a software sales cycle has evolved from a narrow profiled job to a veritable, multi-faceted profession.
The names for this profession sometimes sound fascinating: Presales Consultant, Solution Architect, Sales Engineer, Customer Architect, Evangelist, you name it.
Regardless of the title, however, what they all have in common real business life is:
<li> they support one or more sales reps by being their technical counterpart
<li> they explain, demonstrate and prove to a prospect or customer how an technical offer of your company turns into or is part of a solution that solves a business problem
<li> they own the technical sales cycle end to end
I have spent most of my professional life in this field and was very fortunate to be able to built a career in it, from being an individual contributor back to managing local teams to leading very large, multinational technical sales organizations.
Every company that I have workded for had it's specific challenges but there were equally areas very similar in their nature that I found in all my roles: the "base line" of every technical sales organization!
Having worked on all the them for many years I felt it might be helpful for others to collect them as "topics to think about". Whether your are are growing new into your role of a software presales manager  growing their teams.
Given the the differences between markets "one size fits all solutions"  cannot exist for each of those topic. As a consequence, this collection is comprised of bullet points,
questions to ask, maybe an idea here and there but certainly not of "out of the box" approaches applicable to every Presales team in the world.
