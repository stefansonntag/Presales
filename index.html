Over the last two decades the role that is accountable for the technical part in a software sales cycle has evolved from a narrow profiled job to a veritable, multi-faceted profession.
I have spent most of my professional life in this field and was very fortunate to be able to built a career and manage very large, multinational technical sales organizations for more than 10 years.
Naturally, every company had it's specific challenges but there were equally areas very similar in their nature that I found in all my assignments: the "base line" of every technical sales organization!
Having worked on many of these I felt it might be helpful for others to collect them as "topics to think about", whether these persons are growing into their role or growing their teams.
Given the the differences between markets "one size fits all solutions"  cannot exist for each of those topic. As a consequence, this collection is comprised of bullet points,
questions to ask, maybe an idea here and there but certainly not of "out of the box" approaches applicable to every Presales team in the world.
